# Hadlight Tracker

Headlight Tracker is a CV-based car detection system that detects cars by their headlights. This is done by using several techniques of computer vision alongside some basic machine learning. The detection is based on some parameters that need to be tuned from video to video, like the ROI of detection, headlights separation interval in pixels, amongst other important ones.

Headlight Tracker is a naive approach to the problem of object detection, since it was a final project in the lectures of Introduction to Python, at UFPE's Electronics and Systems Department.


A simple demonstration of the program can be seen on the image below:
